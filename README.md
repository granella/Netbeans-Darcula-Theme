# Netbeans-Darcula-Theme
The Darcula theme is a color scheme for NetBeans IDE in conjunction with the **Darcula LAF for Netbeans** plugin that mimics the Darcula theme from IntelliJ Idea.

## Installation
1.  Get the **Darcula LAF for Netbeans** plugin in one of the following ways.
    * Choose the version and download it from the 
    [Netbeans Plugin Portal](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/62424/darcula-laf-for-netbeans).
    * Open NetBeans and install the new plugin on the NetBeans Plugin Portal Update Center in: `Tools => Plugins`.

2.  Get the **Source Code Pro** font (zip archive) in one of the following ways:
    * Download it from the [download page](https://github.com/granella/Netbeans-Darcula-Theme/releases/download/v1.0/Source_Code_Pro.zip).
    * Download it from the [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro).

3.  Get the **Darcula** theme (zip archive) in one of the following ways.
    * Download it from the [download page](https://github.com/granella/Netbeans-Darcula-Theme/releases/download/v1.0/Darcula.zip).
    * Create the archive by yourself.
      In this case make sure you zip the _'config'_ folder within the main
      theme folder itself (e.g. _Darcula/**config**_).

4.  Open NetBeans and import the new theme by:
    `Tools => Options => Import => Browse...` choose the zip archive
    (e.g. Darcula.zip) `OK`. Now select the `All` option (to import all the settings)
    and finally `OK` again. NetBeans will prompt a window asking you to restart
    the editor in order for the imported settings to be effective. Just confirm.

5.  Enjoy (if everything is ok) or complain (if something wrong happened) =)
